            <h1>BREAKFAST IDEAS</h1>
            </div>
            <p> Breakfast is the most imporant meal of the day... yet, it is also the meal I struggle with the most. I find that I'm not super hungry in the mornings.
                When my classes were in person, (pre-COVID-19), I also found it difficult to make a breakfast when I had class early in the morning. Most of the time, I crave
                savory breakfasts! Below are some of my favorite ways to start my day!
            </p>
        
        <div class="breakfast-format">
        <div class="breakfast-text">
            <a name="avocado-toast"></a>
            <h2>Avocado Toast</h2>
            <p>This loaded avocado toast is my favorite way to start my morning. I love this meal because it is full of carbs, fats and proteins!
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mash half an avocado with lemon or lime juice and spread on a piece of toast</li>
                    <li>Top with tofu scramble; sautee tofu in tomato sauce and seasonings, mix in veggies (mushrooms and spinach are my favorite!)</li>                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>         
        </div>
        <div class="avotoast-image">

        </div> 
        </div> 
    
        <div class = "breakfast-format">
        <div class="breakfast-text">
        <a name="tofu-scramble"></a>
        <h2>Tofu Scramble</h2>
        <p> A tofu scramble is another great way to start the morning, especially if I don't have an avocado or bread on hand! I either prepare it with tomato sauce, as mentioned
            in the avo toast above, or I mix nutritional yeast, Chickenless Seasoning from Trader Joe's, Tumeric (for the yellow, egg like color!) and some other spices for flavor.
            I also love adding some vegetables to this!! It is a great way to get in a power punch of protein!

        <div class="breakfast-format">
            <div class="breakfast-text">
                <a name="smoothie"></a>
                <h2>Smoothie</h2>
                <p>I don't often find myself craving something sweet in the morning, but when I do, I often go for a smoothie! If I work out in the morning, 
                    this is definitely something I reach for as I like adding protein powder! I like to start with a base of bananas and spinach, and I mix in 
                    ingredients such asprotein powder, frozen fruits, chia seeds, hemp seeds, peanut butter and ginger! It varies based on what I have at home, 
                    and what flavors I'm craving! I also love topping it with granola for a nice crunch!
