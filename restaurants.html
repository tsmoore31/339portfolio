                <h1>RESTAURANTS</h1>
                <p> Eating vegan or plant based at restaurants can definitely be tricky at first. I've learned to check menus before I go places, look up reviews, or
                  call ahead to see if there are options! I've found that the majority of the time, restuaurants are incredibly accomodating! I've also learned to get 
                  creative when eating at restaurants, occasionally making meals out of sides! Below are some of my favorite restaurants, and tips for eating vegan at restaurants!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The first few restaurants/locations I have on here are local... I urge you all to try and support these businesses if you're in the area or find the local places 
                  near you through Yelp or Happy Cow! <a href = "https://www.happycow.net/" target = '_blank'> Happy Cow</a> is great because all the restaurants added are added by vegan or vegetarian people. Not all of them are all vegan or vegetarian
                  either which is great if you're eating with non-vegans as I often am. For <a href = 'https://www.yelp.com/' target = '_blank'> Yelp</a>, all you have to do is search "vegan" and I'm sure you will find some local options.

                    <p><a href = "https://thelunchrooma2.com/" target="_blank">The Lunch Room/Detroit Street Filling Station</a> is located here in Ann Arbor, Michigan and is one of my favorites! Particularly now, it is so important to support local businesses. Some of my favorite dishes are:

                <h2>Green Fusion</h2>
                <p> <a href = "https://greenfusionnj.com/" target = '_blank'>Green Fusion</a> is located in my hometown of Ridgewood, New Jersey and is also listed as one of the best vegan restaurants in New Jersey... how lucky am I?? Some of my favorite dishes from them are their pizzas!
                    These pictures are their Seitan Alredo Vegan Pizza and their Potato Croquette appetizer (my new favorite!). They have a new pizza, vegan mac and cheese, that I am so excited to try when I go home in a few days.

                <p> <a href = "https://www.veggiegrill.com/" target = '_blank'>Veggie Grill</a> is a vegan chain but I wanted to include them early because they have really made vegan options more accessible.
                    Most of their locations are on the West coast, however, they recently opened a NYC location and have a few in Boston and Chicago. This is one of my favorite places ever. In these pictures
                    we have their Cauliflower Wings, Chickin "Wings" (more like tenders and a favorite of my non-vegan/vegetarian mother!) and a Philly Cheesesteak.

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <p> There are some other, chain restaurants, that are great to stop at if you're on the road, need a quick meal, or just craving something! If you have any other tips, please fill out my <a href = "index.html#contact-form"> contact form</a> and let me know! I want to make this as helpful as possible.
                    <ul id = "tips_list">
                        <li><b>Nothing on the Menu?</b> -- This definitely takes getting used to, but on the off chance that there is nothing on the menu, and I don't feel like telling my party that I don't want to eat here, I call ahead. Recently when in Chicago,
                            I did this at a restaurant and they ended up making me an AMAZING pasta... it was truly the best thing at the table and everyone loved it. They made me a pasta dish with olive oil, salt, pepper and these incredibly fresh vegetables.
                            So. good. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Chipotle</b> -- I am a huge fan of their Sofritas! I usually get a bowl or burrito with sofritas, both beans, brown rice, vegetables, pico de gallo, corn, lettuce and guac!</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sandwich Shops (Jimmy Johns, Subway...)</b> -- For these places I usually look ahead at which breads are vegan, get every vegetable, no cheese or meat and then a vegan dressing! Get a bag of chips and put them in your sandwich for an extra crunch!</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Taco Bell</b> -- This one surprises people but it is my favorite fast food restuarant and quite vegan friendly. I usually get a Crunch Wrap Supreme with beans. If you order it fresco style, they exchange pico de gallo for the nacho cheese sauce and sour cream, and then I add guacamole. I used to add potatoes (the best.) but Taco Bell took them off the menu unfortunately. Their Cinnamon Twists are also accidentally vegan!</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Burger King</b> -- I rarely go here, it is usually when I'm driving from Ann Arbor back home, but they do have an Impossible Whopper that you can order without mayo and it is vegan!</li>
